# Tasks: Polyomino Puzzle Solver

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-polyomino-puzzle-solver/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL but recommended for this feature. Test tasks are included below using pytest framework.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan (src/models/, src/logic/, src/gui/, src/utils/, tests/unit/, tests/integration/, tests/fixtures/)
- [x] T002 Initialize Python 3.11+ project with PySide6, pytest, pytest-qt, pytest-mock dependencies
- [x] T003 [P] Create requirements.txt with PySide6, pytest, pytest-qt, pytest-mock, flake8, mypy, black, radon
- [x] T004 [P] Configure pytest in pytest.ini with discovery for tests/unit/ and tests/integration/
- [x] T005 [P] Configure flake8 for linting in .flake8 (Note: Using ruff instead - see .ruffignore)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core data models that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Define Puzzle Configuration (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: User can launch application and define puzzle pieces and board shape through a graphical grid editor

**Independent Test**: Launch application, draw a simple piece shape, set board dimensions (e.g., 5x5), and verify the configuration persists in memory. No solving or visualization required.

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently. User can launch app, draw pieces, set board dimensions, and see configuration in editor.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Solve Puzzle Visualization (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: User can click Solve button to open visualization window showing real-time backtracking algorithm attempting to place pieces

**Independent Test**: Define a simple solvable puzzle (e.g., 2x2 board with two L-shaped trominoes), click solve, and verify visualization window opens showing board with pieces being placed and backtracked when dead ends occur.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Define Puzzle Configuration**:
  - Depends on: Foundational phase (models, rotation, validator)
  - No dependencies on other user stories
  - Can be implemented and tested independently

- **User Story 2 (P2) - Solve Puzzle Visualization**:
  - Depends on: Foundational phase + User Story 1 (editor window, puzzle configuration)
  - Integrates with US1 editor window for solve button
  - Should be independently testable for solver logic

- **User Story 3 (P3) - Puzzle Management**:
  - Depends on: Foundational phase + User Story 1 (editor window, puzzle configuration)
  - Integrates with US1 editor window for save/load UI
  - Should be independently testable for file I/O

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD approach)
- Models before services/logic
- Services/logic before GUI components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: T003, T004, T005, T006, T007 can all run in parallel
- **Foundational Phase**: T010-T013 (models) can run in parallel
- **User Story 1 Tests**: T017-T021 can all run in parallel
- **User Story 1 Implementation**: T022-T025 can run in parallel (different files)
- **User Story 2 Tests**: T034-T037 can all run in parallel
- **User Story 2 Implementation**: T038, T042, T043 can run in parallel
- **User Story 3 Tests**: T051-T056 can all run in parallel
- **User Story 3 Implementation**: T057-T060 can run in parallel
- **Polish Phase**: T069-T073 can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T009)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T010-T016) - **CRITICAL**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T017-T033)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**:
   - Launch application: `python -m src.main`
   - Draw a piece shape on the grid
   - Set board dimensions to 5x5
   - Add another piece
   - Verify pieces are displayed with unique colors
   - Delete a piece and verify it's removed
5. Demo: Show users can define puzzle configurations
6. **MVP DELIVERED**: Core value proposition achieved

### Incremental Delivery

1. **MVP Cycle** (as above): Setup → Foundational → US1 → Deploy/Demo
2. **Add User Story 2**: Complete T034-T050 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
   - Define puzzle → Click Solve → Watch visualization
3. **Add User Story 3**: Complete T051-T068 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
   - Save puzzle → Clear editor → Load puzzle → Verify
4. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers (2-3 developers recommended):

1. **Week 1**: All developers complete Setup + Foundational together (T001-T016)
2. **Week 2-3**: Once Foundational is done, split by user story:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Define Puzzle) - T017-T033
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Solver Visualization) - T034-T050
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Puzzle Management) - T051-T068
3. **Week 4**: Integration testing and Polish (T069-T083)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently with minimal conflicts

---

## Format Validation

✅ **All tasks follow strict checklist format**:
- Checkbox: `- [ ]` present on every task
- Task ID: Sequential (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
- [P] marker: Included for parallelizable tasks
- [Story] label: [US1], [US2], [US3] for user story phase tasks
- Description: Clear action with exact file path

**Task Count Summary**:
- Total tasks: 83
- Phase 1 (Setup): 9 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 7 tasks
- Phase 3 (US1): 17 tasks (5 tests + 12 implementation)
- Phase 4 (US2): 17 tasks (4 tests + 13 implementation)
- Phase 5 (US3): 18 tasks (6 tests + 12 implementation)
- Phase 6 (Polish): 15 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 34 tasks marked with [P] can be run in parallel across different phases and within phases.

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach recommended)
- Commit after each task or logical group of tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- User Story 1 is MVP - complete and validate before proceeding to US2/US3
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Testing is recommended but optional - test tasks are included for completeness
